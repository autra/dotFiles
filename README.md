# Dotfiles

My config files. License: do what you want.

## Home-manager

home-manager -f ~/dotFiles/home.nix switch --impure  

## To switch between light / dark theme

My dark theme is gruvbox, my light theme is a custom one :-)

To switch (TODO complete that, it's not as simple as I'd like it to be, even though stylix does already a lot of work):

- lunarvim: switch the colorscheme
- stylix, switch the theme declaration
- switch the delta theme in .gitconfig
- .tmux.conf: TODO
